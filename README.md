<h3>What are Data Structures?</h3><br>
<span>Data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be
accessed and updated efficiently. Each data structure is good and is specialized for its own thing.</span>

<h3>Operations On Data Structures</h3><br>
<ul>
  <li>Insertion: Add a new data item in a given collection of items such as us adding the apple item in memory.</li>
  <li>Deletion: Delete data such as remove mango from our list.</li>
  <li>Traversal: Traversal simply means accessing each data item exactly once so that it can be processed.</li>
  <li>Searching: We want to find out the location of the data item if it exists in a given collection.</li>
  <li>Sorting: Having data that is sorted.</li>
  <li>Access: How do we access this data that we have on our computer?</li>
</ul>
