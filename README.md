accessed and updated efficiently. Each data structure is good and is specialized for its own thing.

##Operations On Data Structures
Insertion: Add a new data item in a given collection of items such as us adding the apple item in memory.
Deletion: Delete data such as remove mango from our list.
Traversal: Traversal simply means accessing each data item exactly once so that it can be processed.
Searching: We want to find out the location of the data item if it exists in a given collection.
Sorting: Having data that is sorted.
Access: How do we access this data that we have on our computer?
